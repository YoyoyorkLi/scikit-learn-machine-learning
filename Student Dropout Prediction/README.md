## Applying ML models to predict college students' dropout status
This script leverages Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict whether 
college students are likely to drop out based on academic, demographic, and socioeconomic features.
  
The script also includes  
  
• Data exploration and trend visualization  
• Computing feature importance and data wrangling  
• Model evaluation and comparison  

## Dataset
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention/data) contains anonymous student information collected from multiple universities in the U.S.  

Some of the features include  
  
• Academic performance  (e.g., GPA)  
• Enrollment history  (e.g., semester attendance)  
• Demographics (e.g., gender, age group)  
• Financial indicators (e.g., scholarship, tuition status)
